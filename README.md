# Javascript-project - FromSoftware Fansite
This is a web project for UCD PA. 
I created this site as a tribute to Fromsoftware games from Tokyo Japan.

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my FromSoftware Games Fan Site! This project is a tribute to the legendary game development company, FromSoftware, known for its challenging and immersive game titles like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Elden Ring. my half functioning website offers quizzes, character creation features, difficulty settings, and a moving gallery to engage fans and celebrate the rich history of FromSoftware games.

Project Overview
The website features:

A quiz on FromSoftware games with instant feedback on answers.
A character class selection tool with descriptions.
A difficulty slider for game customization.
A moving image gallery showcasing game artwork.
An engaging and responsive design for fans to explore their favorite games.
Challenges Faced
Integrating JavaScript for Interactive Elements

Quiz Implementation:

Challenge: Creating a dynamic and responsive quiz that provides instant feedback.
Solution: i used JavaScript to iterate through quiz questions and compare user answers against a set of correct answers, updating the DOM with feedback in real-time.

Character Class Selection:

Challenge: Dynamically updating the UI based on user selections without reloading the page.
Solution: Employed event listeners to capture changes in the dropdown selection and update the character description accordingly.

Difficulty Slider:

Challenge: Reflecting changes in game difficulty through a UI element without page refreshes.
Solution: Implemented a range slider that updates a display element in real-time as the user adjusts the difficulty level.

Moving Image Gallery:

Challenge: Creating a seamless and user-friendly gallery that users can control.
Solution: Used JavaScript to cycle through images at intervals and allowed users to manually navigate with next/previous buttons.

Responsive Design
Challenge: Ensuring the website is fully responsive and accessible across all devices, especially for the image gallery and character creation sections.
Solution: Applied media queries and flexible CSS grid layouts to adjust content dynamically based on the viewport size.

Technologies Used
HTML5 for structured content.
CSS3 for styling and responsive design.
JavaScript for interactive elements and dynamic content updates.
